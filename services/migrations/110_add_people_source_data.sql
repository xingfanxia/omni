-- Add authoritative source data to canonical people records.

-- `people` remains one row per human, merged by normalized business email.
-- `source_data` is an object keyed by source ID. Each value contains that
-- source's current, reviewed workplace-directory data for the person:
--
-- {
--   "<source_id>": {
--     "external_id": "EMP-123",
--     "display_name": "Ada Lovelace",
--     "department": "Engineering",

--     "source_updated_at": "2025-01-01T00:00:00Z"
--   }
-- }
--
-- A missing source key means that source no longer reports the person. This
-- permits source-scoped deletion without a second person table.
-- Only reviewed workplace fields are stored; raw provider data is excluded.
